# Movies-ETL

This challenge required the use of git lfs due to the large datasheets in the resources file. 

In this exercise, the goal was to conver the data files into dataframes, clean up some of the columns and then merge them together to get a full picture of movies and ratings information from multiple sources.

After merging the dataframes together, I needed to upload the new dataframe into SQL and verify accuracy by double checking the count of the movies and ratings rows.
